Introduction
Cluster systems, also known as cluster computing or high-performance computing (HPC), enable the efficient utilization of multiple computers interconnected to form a powerful computing platform. This repository focuses on providing resources and tools for building, configuring, and managing cluster systems to harness their computing capabilities.

Features
Cluster Configuration: Guides and best practices for configuring cluster systems, including hardware setup, network configuration, and cluster management software.
Job Scheduling: Tools and frameworks for efficient job scheduling and resource management on cluster systems, such as Slurm, Torque, and Kubernetes.
Cluster Monitoring: Utilities and dashboards for monitoring the health, performance, and resource usage of cluster nodes and jobs.
Parallel Programming: Resources and libraries for developing parallel and distributed applications, including MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP.
Cluster File Systems: Documentation and examples for distributed file systems designed for cluster environments, such as Lustre, GlusterFS, and BeeGFS.
Cluster Security: Guidelines and best practices for securing cluster systems, including user authentication, access control, and network security.
Cluster Management Tools: Tools and scripts for automating common cluster management tasks, such as node provisioning, software deployment, and system configuration.
